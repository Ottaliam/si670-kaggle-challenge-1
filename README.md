# Human vs. Machine Text Classification

This repository contains our submission for the SI 671 Kaggle competition: distinguishing between human- and machine-generated text.

## Overview

Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini have made it easy to generate text that closely resembles human writing. The goal of this competition is to build a classifier that can accurately identify whether a given text sample was written by a human or generated by a machine.

## Dataset

- **Columns:**
    - `id`: Unique identifier for each text sample
    - `text`: The text content
    - `label`: 1 if machine-generated, 0 if human (provided only in train/validation sets)

- **Files:**
    - Training and validation data include the `label` column
    - Test data does **not** include the `label` column

## Task

Predict the `label` for each entry in the test set. The submission should be a CSV file with columns `id` and `label`, where `label` is your model's prediction.

**Example Submission:**
```
id,label
2,0
5,0
6,0
...
```

## Evaluation

- **Metric:** Binary F1 score (positive class = machine-generated)
- **Leaderboard:**  
    - Public leaderboard: 50% of test data  
    - Private leaderboard: remaining 50% (used for final ranking)

## Submission Instructions

- Submit a CSV file with columns `id` and `label` for the test set.
- Ensure IDs match the test data.
